Assignment 2
============

Implement an interpreter based on the parser you created in the previous assignment. In general, you will need to create a symbol table of a program’s variables and their values. This can be a simple as a key/value pair; Java’s Hashtable is a good approach for this. Assume there is no scoping, so a single table will be enough.
